# Syndergaard-Pitch-Movement-Visualization
## Interactive Application to Visualize the Evolution of Noah Syndergaard's Pitch Movement

In order to run the file, you must have the following packages installed in R:
- tidyverse
- baseballr
- htmlwidgets
- plotly
- crosstalk
- DT

### Usage
With the widget open, you can use the bottom bar to change the season or any of the tools in the top right to play with the visualization to your liking. You can also click on a pitch in the legend in order to remove it from the visualization. If you would like to visualize pitch movement for another pitcher since 2015, this can easily be done by replacing "Syndergaard" in the code with the name of the pitcher of your choosing. Feel free to reach out with any questions. Enjoy!
